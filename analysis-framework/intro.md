# Introduction

The Flatland Analysis Framework is being developed in an effort to better analyse the solutions that are presented for flatland and understand how various techniques influence the results of the solutions.

Currently the tool consists of 2 major sub-modules:

1. The API which provides methods to fetch, process and extract metrics from raw data logged for particular submissions.
2. The Viz Tool Preprocessor which preprocesses the logged submission data into a format which can be uploaded and visualized using the [visualization tool](https://flatland.aicrowd.com/visualization/) \*NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS\*.

```{note}
