Challenge Prizes
================

```{warning}
It has recently been announced that the NeurIPS 2020 conference will [take place fully online](https://medium.com/@NeurIPSConf/neural-information-processing-systems-2020-is-going-virtual-6b8e5661f240). Accordingly, the prizes will soon be updated.
```

**The prizes are four travel grants to the [NeurIPS 2020 conference](http://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/) ✈️**

- The **first place team** in the final round will be awarded one travel grant, no matter what approach they used.
- The **top three teams** in the final round which used a **reinforcement learning approach** for their winning submission will be awarded one travel grant each.

The approach used for each submission needs to be specified in the `aicrowd.json` file as described in the [submission guide](../getting-started/first-submission). 

The winning submissions will be verified manually by the organizers to ensure the method used matches what has been declared in the `aicrowd.json` file. The organizers have the final word when judging the validity of each submission.

```{note}
In the case where the overall first place team would use a reinforcement learning approach, then this team will be awarded two travel grants.
