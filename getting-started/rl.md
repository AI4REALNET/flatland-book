Reinforcement Learning
===

Let's get our hands dirty with some simple reinforcement learning methods!

- The [single agent](rl/single-agent) tutorial will guide through a basic Double DQN implementation which controls a single train

The code from these examples can be found in [the flatland-examples repository](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/flatland/flatland-examples).

With the introductions above you will solve such problems:
