Reinforcement Learning
===

Let's get our hands dirty using some simple reinforcement learning methods!

- The [single agent](rl/single-agent) page will guide through a basic Double DQN implementation which controls a single train

The code in these samples can be found in [the flatland-examples repository](https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/flatland/flatland-examples).

With the above introductions you will solve such problems:
