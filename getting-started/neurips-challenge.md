The **[NeurIPS 2020 challenge](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2020-flatland-challenge/)** is the newest competition around the Flatland environment.

In this edition, we are encouraging participants to develop innovative solutions that leverage **reinforcement learning**. The evaluation metrics and prize distribution are designed accordingly.

**The prizes are four travel grants to the [NeurIPS 2020 conference](http://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/) ‚úàÔ∏è**

- The **first place team** in the final round will be awarded one travel grant, no matter what approach they used.
- The **top three teams** in the final round which used a **reinforcement learning approach** for their winning submission will be awarded one travel grant each.

The approach used for each submission needs to be specified in the `aicrowd.json` file as described in the [submission guide](../getting-started/first-submission). 

The winning submissions will be controlled manually by the organizers to ensure the method used matches what has been declared in the `aicrowd.json` file. The organizers have the final word when judging the validity of each submission.

```{note}
In the case where the overall first place team would use a reinforcement learning approach, then this team will be awarded two travel grants.
